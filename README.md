# 🚀 Terminal Carousel — A Visual Tribute to My Customized Shell

Welcome to my *Terminal Carousel*!
This is more than just a project — it's my personal evolution story from a plain terminal to a digital workspace that feels like **home**.

## ✨ What's Inside?

A beautifully designed **carousel of images** that tells the story of how I customized my terminal using:

* 🎯 **ZSH Shell** with powerful plugins (autosuggestions, syntax highlighting)
* 🌌 **Transparent backgrounds** and a hacker-style aesthetic
* 🌈 **Starship prompt** for a minimal, futuristic look
* 🧠 **Modern CLI tools** like `bat`, `rg`, and more
* 🖋 **Custom fonts, themes, and animations** with `tmux`, `oh-my-zsh`, and more

> "I customized my terminal…
